    "## Python and Databases: DB-API\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python is an object-oriented language (at least in its current version), the DB-API works by creating objects and using the methods attached to those objects. Two types of objects are used: connection objects and cursor objects. A DB-API access works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. first, the program must establish a connection to the database. This is achieved\n",
    "through the connect method that takes in a URL, a user name, and a password\n",
    "and returns a connection object. The method establishes a connection with the\n",
    "database server at the given URL, as a user with the credentials provided.\n",
    "2. the connection object can be used to create a cursor object, with the cursor()\n",
    "method. The cursor object is the one that will be used to send and execute SQL\n",
    "commands.\n",
    "3. The cursor object has an execute method that takes in as parameter a string\n",
    "representing an SQL command. This command is sent to the database server and\n",
    "executed.\n",
    "4. When the command is an SQL SELECT, a result is returned to the cursor object.\n",
    "This result can be retrieved with a variety of fetch commands:\n",
    "    * `fetchall()` will take the whole result and deposit it in a Python variable\n",
    "of type array, with each element of the array representing a record and being\n",
    "itself an array. A typical access with this method will use fetchall() to\n",
    "deposit the result of a query in a Python list and then iterate over the list\n",
    "with a for loop, doing whatever is needed on each row (see example below).\n",
    "However, this can be quite slow if the result returned from the database is very\n",
    "large.\n",
    "    * `fetchone()` will pick a row of the result at random. The typical approach\n",
    "is to call fetchone() inside a loop. This works for large datasets but makes\n",
    "access row-based. When using this function, the value None is returned when\n",
    "no more rows are left; a typical loop (assuming variable cur is the cursor\n",
    "object) is:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        while True:\n",
    "        record = cur.fetchone()\n",
    "        if record == None:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "        ``` \n",
    "        \n",
    "    * An intermediate approach is to use `fetchmany(size=n)` where n tuples are\n",
    "returned at once (when there are fewer than n rows left, the method simply\n",
    "returns; however, many rows are left). This method is also used inside a loop\n",
    "but can be more efficient than fetchone()"
